<h1>It's time to become a hacker.</h1>

<p>
I think you've learned enough programming to start getting into trouble.
And, as a hacker, your first challenge will be to hack in and change some
grades. Your teacher is evil, and has given everyone F's! That is unacceptable.
</p>

<div class="captioned">
<img src="imgs/hacker.jpg" />
Apparently, this is what a hacker looks like.
</div>

<p>
Your teacher uses the java program 'GradeDatabase.java' to record the grades.
It's password protected but maybe you can just guess the password. Why not
give it a try?
</p>

<p>
<ol>
    <li>Copy the 'passcrack' folder from the 'JavaClassPrograms' folder 
    into your personal folder.</li>
    <li>Open up the file '&lt;your_personal_folder&gt;/passcrack/GradeDatabase.java'</li>
    <li>Click Compile</li>
    <li>Click Run</li>
    <li>Enter some password</li>
</ol>
</p>

<div class="captioned">
<img src="imgs/running_grade_database.png" />
You should get this (unless you happen to get the password of course.)
</div>

<p>
There are a bunch of ways to get into an ecrypted file, but most of them are really hard.
The easiest ways is to just guess the right password.
I put a list of 250 common passwords in the 'passcrack' folder.
We're going to write a program which guesses all of those passwords.
That's called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack">"dictionary attack"</a>.
</p>

<p>
First, you need to open up 'PassCracker.java'. This is the code you'll be starting with.
You can use the method <code>CrackerUtils.tryPassword(pass)</code> to check if a password
is correct.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">public class PasswordCracker{

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Throwable{
        String pass = "password";
        System.out.println("Trying password '"+pass+"'");

        //try the password
        if(CrackerUtils.tryPassword(pass)){
            System.out.println("That was the right password!");
        }
        else{
            System.out.println("That's not the right password.");
        }
    }

}</code></pre>

<p>
But that's just one password, so that's not very useful. We're going to need to use something
new called an "array". Arrays store lists of values in the same way that a variable stores a
single value. Here's an example:
</p>

<pre><code class="java">int[] numbers; //create a variable to store our array in
numbers = new int[3]; //create an array that can store 3 integers

numbers[0] = 3; //set the first value in the array to 3
numbers[1] = 5; //set the second value in the array to 5
numbers[2] = 7; //set the third value in the array to 7

//print all the values in the array
System.out.println(numbers[0]);
System.out.println(numbers[1]);
System.out.println(numbers[2]);</code></pre>

<p>That would print:</p>

<pre><code class="java">3
5
7</code></pre>

<p>
This example shows you how to make, fill, and get values from an array. You might notice something
a little bit weird: why is it 0, 1, 2 instead of 1, 2, 3? It's because array's start counting at 0 instead
of 1. 
</p>

<p>I know, it's weird and there's a weird reason for it - some of the very first programmers
figured out that they could avoid typing a couple of characters in a couple of places when they made arrays start at 0
instead of 1. Programmers are really lazy. (Also, it really bothered math teachers and they thought that was funny).
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd08xx/EWD831.PDF">Source</a>
</p>

<p>
Why would you want to use an array instead of just making a bunch of variables?
One reason is that you can do tricky things with an array in a loop:
</p>

<pre><code class="java">//a short-hand way of making an array:
int[] numbers = new int[]{1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1};
int i = 0;
while(i &lt; numbers.length){ //while 'i' is less than the number of numbers
    System.out.println(numbers[i]); //print out the i'th number
    i = i+1; //go to the next number
}</code></pre>

<p>
That code is a lot easier than writing out:
</p>

<pre><code class="java">System.out.println(1);
System.out.println(2);
System.out.println(3);
System.out.println(4);
System.out.println(5);
System.out.println(4);
System.out.println(3);
System.out.println(2);
System.out.println(1);
System.out.println(2);
System.out.println(3);
System.out.println(4);
System.out.println(5);
System.out.println(4);
System.out.println(3);
System.out.println(2);
System.out.println(1);</code></pre>

<p>
Using that same trick, let's modify the 'PasswordCracker' program
to try 5 passwords at once using an array.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">public class PasswordCracker{

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Throwable{
        String[] passwords = new String[]{
            "password",
            "123456",
            "12345678",
            "1234",
            "qwerty"
        }
        int i = 0;
        while(i &lt; passwords.length){
            System.out.println("Trying password '"+passswords[i]+"'");

            //try the i'th password
            if(CrackerUtils.tryPassword(password[i])){
                System.out.println("That was the right password!");
            }
            else{
                System.out.println("That's not the right password.");
            }
            i = i+1; //goto the next password
        }
    }

}</code></pre>

<p>
That's a <em>little</em> bit better... but we still haven't gotten into the file.
Let's just go ahead and try all of the passwords in the password.txt file.
We'll use the method <code>CrackerUtils.getPasswords()</code> which returns
an array of Strings just like <code>keyboard.nextLine()</code> returns a single String.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">public class PasswordCracker{

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Throwable{
        String[] passwords = CrackerUtils.getPasswords();

        int i = 0;
        while(i &lt; passwords.length){
            System.out.println("Trying password '"+passswords[i]+"'");

            //try the i'th password
            if(CrackerUtils.tryPassword(password[i])){
                System.out.println("That was the right password!");
            }
            else{
                System.out.println("That's not the right password.");
            }
            i = i+1; //goto the next password
        }
    }

}</code></pre>

<p>
That should get you into the file. Congradulations! You're a hacker. Give yourself an 'A'
(seriously, you're in the file).
