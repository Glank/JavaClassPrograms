<h1>It's time to become a hacker.</h1>

<p>
I think you've learned enough programming to start getting into trouble.
Your first job as a hacker will be to break into the 'grades.enc'
file in the 'passcrack' folder. That's where your teacher, Mrs. Dufus,
has recorded the grades, and she gave everyone F's!!!
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Dufus uses the java program 'GradeDatabase.java' to get to the grades.
Hm... maybe you can just guess the password?
</p>

<p>
&lt;Help running 'GradeDatabase.java'&gt;

<p>
There's lots of ways you might be able to get into an ecrypted file.
The easiest ways is to just guess the right password.
There's a list of common passwords in the 'passcrack' folder.
We could just try each one until we fine one that works...

Ok, maybe not. How about we write a program to try all those passwords for us?

<pre><code class="java">
public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.println("Hello World");
}
